# GitKraken Clone Example Repo
## Featuring Moby Dick

### Hi there and thanks for exploring Git and GitKraken ðŸ‘‹

**How to use this repository:**

(Just making a change to determine how checkouts work between remote and local. This should change the remote commit id, but not the local reference to origin\main on my local computer)

This repository contains multiple branches, each with a unique README with directions on how to perform a specific Git command with GitKraken and the CLI. 

If you are new to Git, here is an important note: each branch in this practice repo will contain unique text focused on the related Git concept. The text will change depending on which branch you have checked out.    

See the 'Next Steps' section later in this document for specific directions on changing branches.

**Contents:**

1. `main`(this branch) - Provides an example of cloning from GitHub using GitKraken and Git CLI. 
2. `git-commit` - Directions for making a [Git commit][3].
3. `git-revert` - Directions for making a [Git revert][4].

## Git Clone: 

You can follow along with the [video and guide for "What is Git Clone?" on GitKraken.com][1].


#### Set up:

Before cloning the repo, first fork this GitHub repository.  Forking a repository lets you make a copy of a GitHub repository directly to your GitHub account. 

To fork this repository, click the <img src='img/gh-fork-icon.png' alt="drawing" alt='GitHub Fork button' width="100"/> button in the upper right of this page. 

**Congratulations!**  

You have successfully forked a repository ðŸŽ‰

You should now be reading this, and the rest of the instructions, on your own fork!


## Git Clone with Visual Studio Code

1. From your GitHub Repository, click the Code button and copy the HTTPS URL.
2.  
3. Open Visual Studio Code.

4. Switch to the Source Control view (Ctrl+shift+G)

5. Click Clone Repository

6. Paste the URL from the first step and hit enter
   
7. Browse to the folder where you want the project set up (e.g. c:\users\myUserName\source) and select "Set Repository Location"

The code files will be downloaded locally and opened in Visual Studio Code.


**Congratulations!**  

You have successfully cloned a repository ðŸŽ‰


*Now, let's try it with the CLI...*


## Git Clone with the Git CLI

1. Open a terminal and let's make sure Git is installed. Type:
`git --version`and if it tells you the version number, then Git is ready to go. If it is not currently installed, [install it from git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. Change directory to the target location for your soon-to-be cloned repository. For example, if you wanted to clone it into a directory called `Sites` located under your home directory, you would enter 
<br><br>`cd ~/Sites`

3. From your repository on GitHub, click on the "Code" button and copy the URL for the repository.

4. Enter the Git clone command followed by either the SSH or HTTPS URL for the remote repository. 
<br><br>`git clone URL-copied-from-step-3`


**Congratulations!**  


You have successfully cloned a repository with the Git CLI.

You can now change directory to the newly cloned repository, in this case, moby-dick, and start editing your files.  
<br>`cd moby-dick`



## Next Steps

You are reading this on the `main` branch of this repository. 

Keep going! To practice making commits you can switch to the `git-commit` branch. 

To switch branches on GitHub, click the `branches` option towards the top left of the code view and select the branch you want to navigate to. 

To checkout the branch locally and pull from the online branch in the command line type `git checkout -b git-commit origin/git-commit`.

To checkout the branch locally using GitKraken, simply click on the `git-commit` branch in the Remote menu on the left hand side. 


### Working with remotes in GitKraken

You are now set up to work locally and push your changes to GitHub, or work on GitHub and pull those changes locally. 

[Learn more about pulling and pushing over on GitKraken.com](
https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/pushing-and-pulling/)


When using GitKraken, you will see the "Remotes" pane on the left will populate with the name of Remote and its branches. Now you can make your changes and [push them up to your remote](https://gitkraken.com/learn/git/problems/pull-remote-git-branch) so team members can access your updates.

GitKraken also lets you manually add remotes by clicking the plus icon. Here you may paste either the SSH or HTTPS URLs for the repository to add the remote. This is great for adding forks of your project to see what changes team members might be working on. Feel free to add [the original repository](https://github.com/Axosoft/moby-dick) you forked from to see how we evolve this repo in the future.
